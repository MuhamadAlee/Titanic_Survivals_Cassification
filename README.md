# Titanic_Survivals_Cassification

Classification on titanic dataset of Kaggle.

  step 1 : We have performed simple Classification problem to the kaggle dataset of the titanic survivals based on the few features.
  
  Step 2 : We have performed some type of the Feature Engineering and then Feature Selection for the acurate results.
  
  step 3 : We have then Performed GridSearch CV for getting the best Parameters for the best algorithms with best available parameters for the accurate results.

  step 4 : Then we train our model on the training dataset and check that accuracies on the test data and got 78 %. which good to start with.
